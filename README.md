## Tips for Best Sound Quality

- For extremely high volume levels (6-7x), use the "Extreme Boost" preset
- Adjust the Clarity Level to make quiet sounds more audible
- Increase Protection Strength if you hear distortion at high volumes
- Different content types benefit from different settings:
  - Music works best with moderate clarity and light protection
  - Voice content benefits from high clarity and medium protection
  - Movies sound best with balanced settings

## Technical Details

The extension uses the Web Audio API to process and boost audio signals. It:

- Uses a sophisticated audio processing chain with gain, compression, and limiting
- Automatically detects and connects to audio/video elements
- Monitors DOM changes for newly added media elements
- Preserves audio quality while boosting volume
- Handles audio source changes seamlessly
- Works with both regular and Shadow DOM content

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Check if the extension is enabled in Chrome
- Refresh the page if audio elements were present before enabling the booster
- Look for error notifications in the floating UI or bottom-right corner
- If you hear distortion at high volumes, increase the Protection Strength
- For very quiet content, increase the Clarity Level

## Permissions

This extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: Needed to access and modify audio elements on the current page
- **scripting**: Required to inject the volume booster script into web pages
- **storage**: Used to save your preferences between browser sessions, including:
  - Volume level settings (up to 7x)
  - Booster on/off status
  - Floating UI visibility
  - Sound quality settings (clarity enhancement and distortion protection)

## Privacy

This extension:

- Does not collect any user data
- Does not modify any website content except for audio processing
- Works entirely locally in your browser
- Requires only necessary permissions for audio processing

## How It Works

The extension uses three main audio processing components:

1. **Gain Node**: Boosts the overall volume of the audio
2. **Clarity Enhancer** (Compressor): Balances loud and quiet sounds to prevent distortion
3. **Anti-Distortion Shield** (Limiter): Ensures the signal doesn't exceed maximum amplitude

This combination allows for much higher volume levels while maintaining audio quality.
